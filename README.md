# BLE-Based Smart Contact Tracing Application

This repository contains the implementation of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based contact tracing application. The application classifies interactions between smartphones as low or high risk using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- BLE-based proximity detection for contact tracing.
- Machine learning model for classifying interactions as low or high risk.

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model is trained to classify interactions based on the distance between smartphones when Bluetooth is turned on.
